# Let's do some coding

## Setup the environment

The best is to fork this repository to your private bitbucket account and commit changes there in meaningful, well-described chunks.

As a prerequisite you'll need Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Framework 4.7 installed.

If you like to submit a pull request changing this to .NET Core, you're welcome to do so :)

## Structure of the challenges`

The solution contains of 3 challenges.

### Challenge1

`Challenge1` has some unreadable code in `Unreadable.cs` which you are to first understand and then refactor to a more concise version.

You might add some unit tests to guard your changes.

### Challenge 2

`Challenge2` is a simple console application for keeping track of ship loads. Unfortunately it was left off unfinished and needs some love.

The file `Program.cs` contains description of one bug and 6 user stories. Please go through those one by one and commit you work after each user story.

The objective of this challenge is to show your coding and design skills. You are completely free to refactor everything - even creating new projects or whatever you need.

### Challenge 3

`Challenge3` contains a simple react application. The tasks will be shown when you launch the website.

If you know react, you could also do some refactorings in addition to fulfilling the tasks. If you don't know it already it might be enough to figure out just enough to make the changes in an adequate manner.

## Submitting your results

In order to inspect the results, please provide access to your private (or public) clone of your excercise.

If you do not manage to provide the results using bitbucket, you may also provide a zip-file with the results.
