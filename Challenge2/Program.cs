    /* Tasks
   1: Bug: something odd happens when transfering the last container
   2: As a user I want the load of my ships to be persisted so that I can restart the program and continue from where I left (txt-files is enough)
   3: As a user I want to restrict the load pr ship to a max of 4 containers because ship 1 and 2 have a max capacity of 4
   4: As a user I want to register an unlimitted number of ships and make load transfers between them, so that I can manage my whole fleet
   5: As a user I want to specify individual capacities per ship, so that I can handle ships with diferent capacities
   6: As a user I want to also manage trucks, so that I can use the program to manage load of my trucks as well
   7: As a user I want the offloading from trucks to be restricted to the last load, so that it is not possible to unload unreachable goods
